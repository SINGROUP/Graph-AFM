# Graph-AFM
Machine learning molecule graphs from atomic force microscopy images.

Abstract:
_Despite the success of non-contact atomic force microscopy (AFM) in providing atomic-scale insight into the structure and properties of matter on surfaces, the wider applicability of the technique faces challenges in the difficulty of interpreting the measurement data. We tackle this problem by proposing a machine learning model for extracting molecule graphs of samples from AFM images. The predicted graphs contain not only atoms and their bond connections, but also their coordinates within the image and elemental identification. The model is shown to be effective on simulated AFM images, but we also highlight some issues with robustness that need to be addressed before generalization to real AFM images._
